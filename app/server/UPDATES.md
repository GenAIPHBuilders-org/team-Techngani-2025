## Date: [Current Date]

### Summary

Enhanced the authentication system to support user avatars and improved session management, enabling the client-side avatar display in the navigation bar.

### Files Modified

1. **GraphQL Schema Changes:**

   - Added `avatar` field to User type
   - Updated login mutation response to include avatar
   - Enhanced the Me query to return avatar information

2. **Resolver Updates:**

   - Updated auth resolver to include avatar in JWT payload
   - Modified user creation and update flows to handle avatar URLs

3. **Authentication Updates:**
   - Improved JWT token generation with more secure practices
   - Enhanced session validation mechanism
   - Added proper error handling for authentication failures

### Technical Details

#### User Model Enhancements

- Added `avatar` field to the User model in Prisma schema
- Implemented migration to update the database structure
- Added validation for avatar URLs

#### GraphQL Resolvers

- Updated the login resolver to include avatar in the response:

  ```typescript
  @Mutation(() => AuthResponse)
  async login(@Args('input') input: LoginUserInput): Promise<AuthResponse> {
    const { email, password } = input;
    const user = await this.userService.validateUser(email, password);

    if (!user) {
      throw new UnauthorizedException('Invalid credentials');
    }

    const payload = {
      sub: user.id,
      email: user.email,
      name: user.name,
      avatar: user.avatar
    };

    return {
      accessToken: this.jwtService.sign(payload),
      id: user.id,
      name: user.name,
      email: user.email,
      avatar: user.avatar
    };
  }
  ```

- Enhanced the `me` query to properly return the current user with avatar:
  ```typescript
  @Query(() => User)
  @UseGuards(JwtAuthGuard)
  async me(@CurrentUser() user: JwtPayload): Promise<User> {
    return this.userService.findOne(user.sub);
  }
  ```

#### JWT Strategy Updates

- Updated JWT strategy to extract avatar information from tokens
- Enhanced token validation with better error handling
- Improved security measures for JWT verification

#### User Service Enhancements

- Added support for avatar URL validation and normalization
- Implemented methods to update user avatar
- Enhanced user creation flow with avatar support

### Security Improvements

- Added validation for avatar URLs to prevent security issues
- Enhanced JWT payload structure for better security
- Implemented proper error handling for authentication edge cases

### API Changes

- `POST /graphql` (login mutation): Now returns avatar field
- `POST /graphql` (me query): Now includes avatar in response
- `POST /graphql` (createUser mutation): Added support for avatar field

### Future Work

- Implement avatar upload functionality
- Add image processing for avatar optimization
- Create admin capabilities to manage user profiles
